# Egg Fetcher

## Program Description

Fetch eggs into your boxes without hatching them.

2. The "Send to Boxes" option must be set to "Automatic".

## Options

### Go Home when Done:

After the program finishes, go to the Switch Home to idle.

### Fetch Attempts:

Make this many attempts to fetch an egg. The only reason to set this option is to avoid over-fetching of eggs and clogging up all your boxes.

### Travel Time per Fetch:

Spin on your bike for this long before attempting to fetch another egg.
