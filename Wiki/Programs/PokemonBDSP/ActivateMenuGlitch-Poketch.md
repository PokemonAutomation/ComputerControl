### Instructions

1. Stand in front of the Floaroma Town Pokémon center*.
2. Your Pokémon is not following you.

4. Start the program in the game.

(*This program will work with any Pokémon center that has no NPCs that can block your path to/from the escalator. It will not work in the Pokémon league center.)
