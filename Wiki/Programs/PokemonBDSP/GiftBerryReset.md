2. Video Resolution: 1080p or higher in program settings
   > Text recognition is not reliable at low resolutions.
3. Text Speed: Fast

### Instructions

1. Stand facing the npc in her house.
3. Save the game.
4. Start the program in game. Make sure the device is the connected controller.


## Options

This program uses [**Tolerate System Update Menu (fast)**](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/FrameworkSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-fast) to bypass the system update window.


### Go Home when Done:

After finding a desired berry, go to the Switch Home to idle.


### Game Language:

The game language so that the program knows to do text recognition in which language.

If you are playing in an Asian language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese), set your video resolution to 1080p or higher. These languages are difficult to accurately read with text recognition at low resolutions.
