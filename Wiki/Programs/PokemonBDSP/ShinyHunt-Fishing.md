   > **Recommended for Performance**
   > - Your lead Pokémon is not shiny.

   > - Your lead Pokémon does not have an ability that activates upon entry to battle.


### Instructions

1. Stand facing water that can be fished.
2. Have the fishing rod registered as one of the Dpad shortcuts.
3. Start the program in game. Make sure the device is the connected controller.


## Options


### Go Home when Done:

After finding a shiny, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.


### Game Language:

If set to a language, the program will attempt to read the name of each Pokémon you encounter and log it.

If you are playing in an Asian language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese), set your video resolution to 1080p or higher. These languages are difficult to accurately read with text recognition at low resolutions.


### Fishing Shortcut:

This is the Dpad button that is used to quickly trigger the fishing rod.


## Advanced Settings:
These are advanced settings. You shouldn't need to touch these unless something isn't working and you're trying to debug it yourself.


### Exit Battle Timeout:

After running, wait this long to return to the overworld. The program will resume before this time if it detects that that the battle has ended.
