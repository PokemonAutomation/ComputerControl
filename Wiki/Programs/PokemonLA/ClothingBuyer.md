### Setup of Settings

1. Text speed is fast.

### Instructions

1. You are in the menu for buying clothing. (Anywhere is fine.)
2. Start the program in the game.

### Default Program Settings

This program is not particularly efficient, but will properly handle items that have already been purchased. It will eventually clear an entire store regardless of how many items there are in each category.

Preliminary testing suggests that this program takes an hour or two to buy out the entire clothing store and require about two million Pokémon Dollars.

*Be aware that this program may change your clothing. So you may need to fix it when you're done.*

   > Note that this program does not stop since it does not know when it is done. Therefore you must stop it manually and check to see if it there is anything left to buy.


## Options

### Category Rotation

If checked, the program moves to the next category after trying to buy one item. This allows the program to visit all categories to buy all clothing, albeit at a very slow speed.

If unchecked, the programs only buys the items in the same category.
