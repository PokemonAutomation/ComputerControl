### Enroute Shiny Action

What to do when finding a shiny enroute to destination

**Shiny Detected Action:**
- Ignore the shiny. Do not stop the program.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot. Then go Home.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot + video. Then go Home.

**Screenshot Delay:**

If the above is set to stop on a shiny, the program will align the camera and wait X time to potentially allow the shiny to come into view of the camera.
This has no functional affect on the program. Don't set this value too large as some Pokémon will run away from you.
