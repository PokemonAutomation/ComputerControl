## Program Description

Grind Pokédex research tasks from Ingo's regular battles.

This program will repeatedly attend Ingo's regular battles, send Pokémon to battle with specified move styles. The difference with Ingo Battle Grinder is that it will be very inneficient at farming experience, evolving Pokémon, etc BUT it will focus only on grinding the Pokédex research tasks.

This program works on game version 1.0 and later.

The program will repeatedly talk to Ingo. It will choose an battle opponent according to the option. You can specify what styles you want to use on each move.

## Options

### Opponent

The name of the opponent you choose to battle against. You need to have the full list of opponents unlocked to ensure the program can find the correct opponent.


### Pokémon Action Table
A table where each row sets the moves you want to pick.

It will pick them with the style you chose and if all pokémon that have a move to grind are KO or you ran out of PP, it will use Arceus and spam judgement to finish the battle. Keep in mind is is move ATTEMPTS and you might fail to succeed them (paralysed, confused, sleeping, miss, immunity, etc). Pick an opponent to have the least interference possible.
