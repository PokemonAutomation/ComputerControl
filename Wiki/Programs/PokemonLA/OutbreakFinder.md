### Settings

1. Screen size: Must be 100% within the Switch settings
2. Video Resolution: 1080p or higher in program settings
   > Text recognition is not reliable at low resolutions.
3. Text speed is fast.
4. Make sure the Game Language is set correctly. This program needs to read the Pokémon names!
5. If MMO Pokémon are desired:
   
   5.1 Remove all the player-placed map markers (e.g. flag, berries, ores, Pokémon and pokeballs) that
may overlap with MMO Pokémon locations. 
   
   5.2 Remove all the satchels that may overlap with MMO Pokémon locations.
Picked satchels will respawn randomly on the map after loading the map again after a while.
So you may need to pick them up repeatedly until all the spawned satchels don't overlap with MMO Pokémon locations.

   Check Serebii [page](https://www.serebii.net/pokearth/hisui/obsidianfieldlands.shtml) like this to know all the MMO Pokémon locations
on a map.
   > The program uses Pokémon sprite image matching at each MMO Pokémon location. Any map marker or satchel overlap on that location may fail sprite matching.
   > The program can still correctly detect MMO Pokémon on those locations that have no overlap.

### Instructions

1. You have unlocked at least one region. (Obsidian Fieldlands)
2. For all the regions that have been unlocked, entering them will not trigger any plot events.
3. You have no unreported research.
4. You are in Jubilife city standing in the position pictured below.
5. If MMO Pokémon are desired:

   5.1 You have fully unlocked MMO Pokémon by finishing all the MMO side quest line.

   5.2 You have at least 5 Aguav Berries in your satchel.

You can also look for MMO occurance at any area by adding the MMO symbol to the list.

### Desired MMO Pokémon with Shiny Symbols
