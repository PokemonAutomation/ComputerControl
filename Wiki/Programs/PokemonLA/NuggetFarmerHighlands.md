# Nugget Farmer (Coronet Highlands)

## Program Description

Farm nuggets (and therefore money) from the Miss Fortune sisters.

This program will repeatedly seek out and battle Charm in the Coronet Highlands.

Although this program is not intended to be a shiny hunting program, it nevertheless will listen for shinies and stop for them if the user chooses so.

The following Pokémon lie on or near the path taken by this program and can therefore be shiny hunted by this program:
- Carnivine
- Bronzor
- Bronzong
- Teddiursa
- Ursaring
- Shinx
- Luxio
- Luxray

There may be other spawns not on this list that the program may (but rarely) come near.

Note: we have now a more efficient program to earn money and exp: [Tenacity Candy Farmer](TenacityCandyFarmer.md).

The program will repeatedly warp to Coronet Highlands and try to find and battle Charm. It will also pick up an Iron Chunk that lies along the path. The chance of finding Charm on each trip is 1-in-5. In the post game, defeating her will reward you with 4 or 5 nuggets.

If the program finds a shiny, it still stop and go to the Switch home to freeze the game. You can change this behavior in the options.


## Options

None specific to this program.


### Shiny Detected Actions

This program detects shinies by listening for the shiny sound. You can configure what the program should do if it hears a shiny.

**Shiny Detected Action:**
- Ignore the shiny. Do not stop the program.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot. Then go Home.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot + video. Then go Home.

**Screenshot Delay:**

If the above is set to stop on a shiny, the program will align the camera and wait X time to potentially allow the shiny to come into view of the camera.
This has no functional affect on the program. Don't set this value too large as some Pokémon will run away from you.
