The program will loop through going from the village to Froslass's cave until a shiny is found, in case no shiny found it resets the game. 

**Notes:**

- If you using Discord notifications please bear in mind sometimes the screenshot won't show the shiny.
- Upon finding a shiny, the program will go back to home screen. Go back to game and save before attempting to catch the shiny. 


## Options


### Enroute/Destination Shiny Action

This program detects shinies by listening for the shiny sound. You can configure what the program should do if it hears a shiny.

There are two of these options - one for enroute, and one for the destination. Thus you can customize the behavior - such as ignoring shinies while enroute.

**Shiny Detected Action:**
- Ignore the shiny. Do not stop the program.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot. Then go Home.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot + video. Then go Home.

**Screenshot Delay:**

If the above is set to stop on a shiny, the program will align the camera and wait X time to potentially allow the shiny to come into view of the camera.
This has no functional affect on the program. Don't set this value too large as some Pokémon will run away from you.
