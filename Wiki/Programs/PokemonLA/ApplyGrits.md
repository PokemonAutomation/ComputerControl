The program will apply each Grit item onto the party Pokémon in the party order.
The number of Pokémon is controlled by the option **Num Pokémon to Apply Grits**.

Since it's a non-feedback program, it may try to use the items onto a stat that cannot be applied any more. But this will not break the program.
