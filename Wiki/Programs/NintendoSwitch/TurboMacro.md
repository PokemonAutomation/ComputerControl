# Nintendo Switch: Turbo Macro

## Program Description

Turbo Macro is a kinda advanced program that let you run any loop of actions you wish. It can be useful for blindly automating some macros. If you create a macro and think it would be useful for others, feel free to share it on discord and other people will be able to load your macro (or we can even create a new program from it)

### Instructions

1. It is an advanced program and can do pretty much whatever you wish so the instructions on how to use it will depends on what your macro is doing


## Options

# Ticks to hold
All of the actions have a ticks to hold option. This is the amount of ticks the chosen action will be pressed (125 ticks = 1 second)

# Ticks to release
All of the actions have a ticks to release option. This is the amount of ticks that will be waited after doing the action (125 ticks = 1 second)

# X and Y
For the joystick actions, you'll have to input the X / Y values representing the position of the joystick you wish to input
x = 0 is left, x = 255 is right. y = 0 is up, y = 255 is down. 128 is neutral for both
