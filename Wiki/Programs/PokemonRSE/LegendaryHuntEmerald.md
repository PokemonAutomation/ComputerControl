## Notes

If you stop the program and switch off or soft reset your game, try to vary the amount of time you wait before starting the program again. This is due to Emerald's broken RNG.

## Options

### Target:

The legendary Pokemon you are hunting.

For Deoxys, see [Shiny Hunt - Deoxys](ShinyHuntDeoxys.md) instead.
