## Setup

1. Your party must contain exactly 5 Pokemon.
2. Nothing in your party will evolve after catching your target.
3. The IV judge is unlocked and the current box view is set to the IV panel.
4. The language option is set to match your in-game language. This is required to read ball names.
5. The actions table is set up to the IVs you want.

## Instructions

1. Stand in front of your target and save the game.
	- For the Treasures of Ruin, their vault must first be unlocked by pulling their respective stakes.
2. Start the program in-game.
	- Master Ball strongly recommended for legendaries.
	- If you cannot throw a Pokeball (ex. Chi-Yu used Bounce) the game will use your Pokemon's first move. Make sure to set the first move of all Pokemon in your party to something non-damaging/False Swipe.

## Notes
- The game will reset if it runs out or cannot find the selected Pokeball.
- Fainted Pokemon will be swapped out.
- It is recommended to hunt for 0IV only, as all other stats can be bottle capped.
- This program does not include the former titan Pokemon, Koraidon, Miraidon, Ogrepon, or Terapagos as their IVs and natures are locked.
- Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, Iron Crown, and Iron Boulder are supported for nature only, as they are all IV locked. Make sure to set the IV filters to Anything.
- For Ursaluna, use [Stats Reset - Bloodmoon Ursaluna](StatsResetBloodmoon.md).
- In Versions 0.39.4 and below, the program will reset the game if your lead Pokemon faints or if your target is invulnerable (Bounce).

## Options

### Target:

The Pokemon you are resetting for.
- Treasures of Ruin: Set to this if you are targeting Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, or Chi-Yu. Their vaults must be unlocked.
- Loyal Three: Use this for Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti.
- Snacksworth Legendary + Meloetta: For Meloetta and the legendaries in Paldea that are unlocked after completing BBQs for Snacksworth.
- Indigo Disk Paradoxes (nature only) + Gimmighoul: Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, Iron Crown, and Iron Boulder for nature only. Gimmighoul for both IVs and nature.

### Game Language:

Select the language that matches what you are using in-game. This setting is required.

### Ball Select:

The ball you want to catch your target in.

### Throw Quick Ball:

Check this to throw a Quick Ball on the first turn of the battle. If there are moves in the Move Table, they will run after the Quick Ball is thrown.

### Move Table:

Pre-program a sequence of moves for your lead Pokemon to use. If your lead faints or the end of the table is reached, the program will stop following the table and switch to throwing the selected ball. Delete all the rows in the table if you only want to throw balls and do not want to use any moves.

### Actions Table:
Use this table to specify the criteria for keeping a legendary. There is no shiny filter or check, as the Pokemon this program are intended for are all shiny locked.

### Go Home when Done:

Go to the Switch Home to idle when finished.
