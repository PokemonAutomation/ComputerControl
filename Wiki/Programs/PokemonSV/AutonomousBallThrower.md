# Autonomous Ball Thrower

**Indigo Disk DLC2 Update:** This program still works, but it does not properly detect catch/fail on the DLC2 legendaries.

## Program Description

Keep throwing ball until you catch the Pokémon you're fighting. In case of failure to catch the Pokémon (in case your Pokémon or the opposing Pokémon faint, you run out of balls, etc) it will stop the program.
