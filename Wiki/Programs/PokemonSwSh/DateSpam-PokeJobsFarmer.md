### Setup of Settings

1. Text Speed: Fast
2. Casual mode: Off
3. System time: Un-synced

   > **Warning:** If you have all eight badges, it is recommended to complete the ten-stars Poké Job at least once before using this program. This Poké Job is named _Top-secret project_. When this special job is completed the first time, the only jobs available are EV-training jobs. If this program is run in this state, Pokémons will receive EV-training which might not be intended.

### Instructions

1. Place the Pokémons to be trained in the same box
2. The box must either be box #1 or the box before it must all be full
3. Select the box then close the menu
4. Stand in front of the Rotom machine
5. Start the program in game 

### Default Program Settings

The default settings for this program completes a single Poké Job per day during 200 days.

   > While the concurrency setting allows one to train more Pokémons at once, setting the concurrency too high will deplete all experience training jobs possibly sending Pokémons to EV-training jobs.
