# Friend Search Disconnect

## Program Description

Disconnect from the internet using the friend search method.

This program is useful for activating the Y-COMM glitch while playing on the computer or remotely. This is because:
1. You cannot enter airplane mode while docked.
2. You cannot sleep the Switch since the device cannot wake it back up.

Therefore, friend-search is the only remaining option.
