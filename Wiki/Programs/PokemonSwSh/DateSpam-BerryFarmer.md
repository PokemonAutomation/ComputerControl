### Setup of Settings

1. Text Speed: Fast
2. Casual mode: Off
3. Y-Comm glitch must be active
   1. Verify glitch is active by checking for a "flash" when re-entering the game from the Home menu.

### Instructions

1. You must be standing in front of a berry tree.
2. Your location should be safe from getting attacked by wild Pokémon.
3. Start the program in game or the [Change Grip/Order Menu](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md) depending on which option you choose.

   > **Stability Recommendation:** Stand behind the berry tree so that the tree is directly in front of (and blocking) your character. Sometimes, the program will miss a button press which causes the date-spamming to happen in the game instead of the Switch settings. This will cause the character to move downwards and away from the tree if you’re not standing behind it.


## Options

This program does not have the ability to avoid the system update window. Should the window appear while the program is running, the program will enter a safe do-nothing loop within the Switch settings.

Most of the options here are self-explanatory.
