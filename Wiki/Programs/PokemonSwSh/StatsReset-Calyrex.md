# Calyrex Stats Reset

Repeatedly catch calyrex (and its horse) until you get the stats you want.

## Preparation Instructions

## Party Setup

1. Your lead Pokémon must be able to "wall Calyrex"
   1. This means Calyrex is unable to damage your Pokémon
   2. See the associated [Pokémon Walls](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/PokemonSwSh/PokemonWalls.md) appendix page.

## Instructions

   4. Close the menu.
4. Save.
   1. The program will press "A" to start the encounter
5. Run the program.

> **NOTE:** In order to check that everything is working properly, I encourage you to let it run first with masterball for an easy catch that would allow you to fix your setup if needed.
