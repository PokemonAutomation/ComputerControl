# Egg Fetcher Multiple

## Program Description

Fetch eggs into your boxes without hatching them.

This program is used with [EggHatcher](EggHatcher.md) to fetch and hatch eggs. Thus you first fetch a bunch of eggs with EggFetcher, then you hatch them with EggHatcher.

Unlike the other egg fetcher, it will fetch a chosen number of eggs before switching one parent and trying again.

### Setup of Settings

1. Text Speed: Fast
2. Casual mode: Off
3. The "Send to Boxes" option must be set to "Automatic".
4. Your bike must be fully upgraded.
5. The first parent (breedable with ALL other parents so probably a ditto) is already deposited at the Route 5 daycare center (first slot).
6. The other parents are in the current box, without any gap.
7. A random pokemon is deposited at the Route 5 daycare center (second slot).

> Strongly Recommended:
> - Masuda Method: The Pokémon in the daycare are of different languages.
> - Have the Oval Charm.
> - Have the Shiny Charm.
> - Have only one kind of egg cycle (or the fetched eggs will be harder to hatch)

### Party Setup

1. Your party is full and none are eggs.

### Instructions

1. Travel to Route 5.
2. Get on your bike.
3. Open the menu and place the cursor over the "Town Map" option.
4. Hit "B" to return to the overworld (not in a menu).
5. Check that there is nothing in front of you that can be interacted with.
6. Start the program in game or the [Change Grip/Order Menu](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md) depending on which option you choose.

> *If you are playing in Japanese or Italian, you need to [**"Egg Fetch Extra Line"**](PokemonSettings.md#egg-fetch-extra-line) or this program will not work.*
