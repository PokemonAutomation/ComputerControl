# Pokémon Home - National Dex Sorter

## Program Description

Find and store Pokémon in you Pokémon Home according to their Pokédex number.
This only works with languages that have the same Pokémon names as the English version.

## Preparation Instructions

1. Screen size: Must be 100% within the Switch settings
2. Video Resolution: 1920 x 1080 in program settings

## Instructions

1. Open Pokémon Home and reach the select game tab.
2. Select the Pokémon Home icon and enter a random box.
3. Run the program

## Options

### Pokédex # of first Pokémon to sort:

The sorting will begin from this Pokémon.

### Pokédex # of last Pokémon to sort:

The sorting will not go on after this Pokémon is sorted.

### Store Pokémon starting from this Box Page:

Selects which Box page you want to start storing your sorted Pokémon in. Sorting the whole National Dex requires an entire page (30 boxes) and a box on the next page so you can't chose page #7.

### Look for shiny Pokémon first:

If this flag is checked the program will try to find a shiny version of every Pokémon first. If it fails it will then try to find a regular version of the same Pokémon.
If this flag is not checked the first Pokémon of that species will be selected, regardless of its shinyness.
