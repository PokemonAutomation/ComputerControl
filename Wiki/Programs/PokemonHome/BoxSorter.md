## Program Description

Order boxes of Pok√©mon Home based on their national dex number.

## Preparation Instructions

1. Screen size: Must be 100% within the Switch settings
2. Video Resolution: 1280 x 720 or higher in program settings

## Instructions

1. Go to the first box you want to sort
2. Try the program with one box to figure out camera and game delay
3. Select the number of boxes you want to order

## Options

### Number of boxes to order:

This is the number of box the program will sort going to the right (the first box count in this number)

### Camera Delay:

This is the delay of your capture card, every capture card have some delay cheap ones tend to have more, you will have to run the program a bit to see what delay works best for you

### Game delay:

This is the pokemon home app delay, this delay need to be increased if you plan on doing a lot of boxes (10 is too low for more than 20), the more delay you put the slower the sort will be. 
Make sure to put some margin if you are not confident with the delay you have chosen
