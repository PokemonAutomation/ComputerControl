        "Changes": "<b>Version 0.59.1:</b><br><br><b>Initial PLZA Programs!</b><br>- Restaurant Farmer<br>- Clothing Buyer (credit kichi)<br><br>Yes, we are well aware of the insane shiny hunting environment. And we are aware that everyone has been using Turbo Button to write their own macros and that the keyboard recoding program is not useful because it cannot loop commands.<br><br>Please be patient. We are working on a proper shiny hunting program complete with shiny detection. But it will take time. It's a very long and grindy game and we all have full time day jobs. So most of us still haven't even beaten the game yet and are very much behind everyone else.<br><br>Other Changes:<br>- The Record Keyboard Controller program now supports looping. This should make it easier to make macros for PLZA shiny hunts! (credit jw)<br>- SV Auto Story has been further extended. (credit jw)<br>- ESP32 and Pico W now support reconnecting outside of the grip menu.<br>- The wiki has been migrated to github.io. (credit Gin)<br><br><br><b>Important note about SV Auto Story:</b><br><br>SV Auto Story's required moveset for Gardevoir has changed. Now it is (in order):<br>- Moonblast<br>- Dazzling Gleam<br>- Mystical Fire<br>- Misty Terrain.<br><br>Note Mystical Fire's positioning change and the addition of Misty Terrain instead of Psychic.<br><br><br><b>Wireless Controller Changes:</b><br><br>This release now allows wireless controllers (ESP32 and Pico W) to reconnect to the Switch after pairing. After it has paired with the Switch, switching to a different controller and switching back will attempt to reconnect to the paired Switch. It no longer requires you to be in the grip menu.<br><br>Likewise, the behavior of the "Reset Ctrl" has changed. Now, if you click it, it will try to reconnect to the same Switch. If you want to clear the pairing and connect to a new Switch (the old behavior), you must SHIFT+click.<br><br>However, due to an resolved issue on the ESP32, reconnects will usually fail on a Switch 1 (but it works on the Switch 2). So you will likely need to go back to the grip menu and SHIFT+click to redo the pairing. Pico W does not have this issue and will reliably reconnect to both Switch 1 and Switch 2. We are still working to fix this issue."

        "VersionPatch": 24,
        "Changes": "<b>Version 0.54.24 (Release Candidate):</b><br><br>- Added partial support for the Switch 2 GR and GL buttons. All keyboard settings will be reset to default due to the button mappings shifting.<br>- Fixed Arduino/Teensy and ESP32-S3 controllers hanging if the Switch refuses the connection. New firmware will be needed.<br>- Fixed all PLA programs that navigate regions being broken. (regression in v0.54.12)<br>- The Home Box Sorter should recognize PLA balls now.<br>- Fixed SBB allowing joysticks to go diagonally out-of-bounds. (reported by Koi)<br>- Fixed a possible deadlock with SBB.<br>- Fixed an issue in the button scheduler where it may issue incorrect commands.<br>- Various stability improvements to CC itself."

        "Changes": "<b>Version 0.56.4 (beta):</b><br><br>- The ESP32 will now connect to the Switch 2!<br>- The ESP32-S3 now lets you pick between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 wired controllers.<br>- Improved reliability of SV eggs with a new path to navigate to the egg basket.<br>- SV egg programs will fix your game settings.<br>- SV egg programs will warn you if it thinks your language is wrong.<br>- Fixed another program crash. (from error reports)<br><br>A lot of changes happened to the firmware, so you will need to flash new .hex and .bin files regardless of what you are using.<br><br>Note that all 4 shiny hunting LGPE programs have been affected by the new firmware changes due to the game disconnecting all controllers when SR'ing. This \"just happened\" to work in the past, but with the new firmware, it has become a lot more delicate.<br><br>As of today, these 4 programs should be working fine on the Switch 2 (only Gift Reset has been tested). But Switch 1 is more precarious since we are unable to get the ESP32 to reliably reconnect to the Switch outside of the grip menu. (for some reason it works perfectly on the Switch 2 - ironic yes)"
