If you have custom keyboard mappings, you will need to redo them.<br>- Fixed battles sometimes not picking a move - affecting Jacinthe Farmer. (reported by jojoaman and kichi)<br>- Fixed duration fields jumping the cursor around. (reported by bgoproton)<br><br>Wired OEM controllers were actually released in the previous version (v0.60.8). But the wiki wasn't ready for it at the time. So it is being announced as part of this release."

        "Changes": "<b>Version 0.56.4 (beta):</b><br><br>- The ESP32 will now connect to the Switch 2!<br>- The ESP32-S3 now lets you pick between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 wired controllers.<br>- Improved reliability of SV eggs with a new path to navigate to the egg basket.<br>- SV egg programs will fix your game settings.<br>- SV egg programs will warn you if it thinks your language is wrong.<br>- Fixed another program crash. (from error reports)<br><br>A lot of changes happened to the firmware, so you will need to flash new .hex and .bin files regardless of what you are using.<br><br>Note that all 4 shiny hunting LGPE programs have been affected by the new firmware changes due to the game disconnecting all controllers when SR'ing. This \"just happened\" to work in the past, but with the new firmware, it has become a lot more delicate.<br><br>As of today, these 4 programs should be working fine on the Switch 2 (only Gift Reset has been tested). But Switch 1 is more precarious since we are unable to get the ESP32 to reliably reconnect to the Switch outside of the grip menu. (for some reason it works perfectly on the Switch 2 - ironic yes)"
